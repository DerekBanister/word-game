//We want to declare global variables that are the words used in our game. Possibly an array of possible words that is selected from each time a function is called upon
//var Names1 = [
 //   duck
  //  cow
  //  Bird
  //  muskrat
//]



//Create a function that has an eventlistener that begins the game and starts a timer when the button is clicked.



//Create a seperate function that handles the timer



//We need also create a function that tracks the users key inputs and relates them to the name that has been chosen in our variables names1



//set localstorage to track whether the user wins the game or loses the game



//Make a scoreboard that displays the localstorage data
